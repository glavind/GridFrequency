# GridFrequency
Short project investigating the grid frequency in the Nordic and Continental European power grids.

## Research Objectives
1. Download data from an API and a Web server using R.
2. Store and handle large datasets.
3. Handle timeseries data that cross daylight saving.
4. Create beautiful, informative graphs using both the ggplot2 and Lattice packages.
5. Generate this document in R using Knitr/Markdown.
6. Answer research questions:
    + What differences in grid frequency quality can be observed between the Nordic and Continental electricity grids?
    + Is the European grid frequency exactly 50 Hz on average?
