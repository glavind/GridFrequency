# GridFrequency
Short project investigating the grid frequency in the Nordic and Continental European grids.

## Research Objectives
1. Download data from an API and a Web server using R.
2. Store and handle a large dataset.
3. Handle timeseries data that cross daylight saving.
4. Create beautiful, informative graphs using both ggplot2 and lattice.
5. Craft a piece of reproducable research.
6. Answer research questions:
    + What differences in grid frequency quality can be observed between the Nordic and Continental electricity grids?
    + Is the European power grid frequency exactly 50 Hz on average?
